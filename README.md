# Git-Commands-App

    The idea is to create a small applications that allows you to select the command you want <br>
    with a list of all the possible commands.

## How does it work

    Basic Structure

    git "1st command" "2nd command" .....  [copy button]<br>

    By selecting the "1st command" a list of "2nd command" will appear <br>
    By Hovering (or written on the side) you can see the description of that command

## How can you help (if you want to....)

    I'm going to need help in creating / finding all the commands and write them in a list.<br>

    Before starting to help, write in the discord channel what you are going to do.<br>

    Make a new .md file with the name of the "1st command". Inside that file make a list of "child" "grandchild" ecc <br>
    To have a similar structure do it like this:
        - on the first line start with  "2nd command" : Description : list of child commands

        - the nextline once you finished the "2nd command" will be:
            # "2nd command" childs
            "child" : description : "grandchilds"
            and you go on and on and on and on and on.......

    I'm still open for idea for everything

    Not interested in the list, but wanna code some front/backend?
    Just let me know what you wanna do and start coding!
