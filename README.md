# Git-Commands-App

    The idea is to create a small applications that allows you to select the command you want <br>
    with a list of all the possible commands.

## How

    Basic Structure

    git "1st command" "2nd command" .....  [copy button]


    By selecting the "1st command" a list of "2nd command" will appear
    By Hovering (or written on the side) you can see the description of that command
